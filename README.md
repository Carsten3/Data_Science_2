Project: Explainability of Airbnb Pricing using Shap
For our course project, we focused on the explainability of Airbnb pricing using a tool called Shap. Airbnb is a popular online marketplace for renting and hosting accommodations. Understanding the factors that influence the pricing of Airbnb listings is crucial for both hosts and guests.

The Shap (SHapley Additive exPlanations) tool is a powerful framework that provides model-agnostic explanations for individual predictions. It helps us understand the impact of different features on the predicted outcome. In our project, we used Shap to analyze and interpret the factors affecting Airbnb pricing.
